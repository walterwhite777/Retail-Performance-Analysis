## 1. Revenue Trends Analysis (For CEO)
### Question
Analyze the time series of revenue data for 2011 to identify seasonal trends and provide forecasting insights for revenue growth.

### Answer
The 2011 revenue data shows a fluctuating trend, starting at \$0.69M in January, dipping to \$0.52M in February, and peaking at \$1.51M in November, before declining to \$0.64M in December. The first eight months average \$0.69M, with a 40% surge in September (\$1.06M) leading to the November peak, likely due to holiday seasonality. The December drop suggests a post-holiday slump.

## 3. Top 10 Customers Analysis (For CMO)
### Question
Evaluate the top 10 customers by revenue to inform customer retention and growth strategies.

### Answer
Customer 14646 generates the highest revenue at $272K, followed by 18102 at \$232K, down to 16029 at \$68K. Notably, the highest revenue-generating customer only purchased 17% more than the second-highest, indicating the business is not overly reliant on a few customers. This suggests low customer bargaining power, positioning the company favorably. The top five customers drive the majority of revenue, highlighting the importance of customer retention.

**Recommendations for Customer Retention:**
- Prioritize tailored services (e.g., exclusive discounts, dedicated support) for the top five customers to ensure retention.
- Develop targeted promotions for lower-tier customers (e.g., 14156, 16029) to boost their contribution.
- Analyze the top customer’s purchasing behavior to replicate successful strategies across the customer base.

## 4. Global Demand Distribution (For CEO)
### Question
Assess demand across all countries, excluding the UK, to guide market expansion strategies.

Europe dominates demand, with the Netherlands (194K units), EIRE (142K units), and Germany (112K units) leading. Australia (84K units) and Japan (22K units) show moderate demand, while Africa (e.g., South Africa at 352 units) and Asia (beyond Japan) are minimal. This indicates a strong European base with market expansion potential in Australia, Japan, and emerging markets like Brazil (356 units).
